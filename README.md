# ðŸ“Š Dynamic Array Implementation in Java

This project is a custom implementation of a **dynamic array** similar to Java's built-in `ArrayList`. It demonstrates manual memory management, array resizing, and interactive operations using object-oriented principles.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Add elements dynamically with automatic resizing
- âœ… Insert elements at any valid position
- âœ… Delete elements from a given position
- âœ… Search for a value in the array
- âœ… Display all elements
- âœ… Interactive menu-driven interface via console

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java
- Arrays and basic data structures
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Console-based user input (`Scanner` class)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Objectives

- Understand how dynamic arrays work internally
- Apply logic for resizing arrays (`Arrays.copyOf`)
- Practice array element shifting during insertion and deletion
- Build structured, readable, and testable Java code
- Enhance understanding of input validation and error handling
